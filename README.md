# Overview 
Research is always important because it allows scientists and engineers to contribute to development and advancement of new achievements and technologies. Researchers in different institutions submit proposals for projects to ask for funds from different resources. The Ontario Research Fund provides research institutions with funding to cover the cost of project operations including salaries, supplies, etc. 

# Background and motivation
 -  To help researchers to predict the range of funds they can achieve based on the project they are proposing
 
# Goals
 -  Build a classifier to predict the range of fund based on project title
 
# Datasets
 - This data set provides details from research projects funded through the Research Infrastructure Program (2003 to the present). It is also availabe in the data/raw folder
