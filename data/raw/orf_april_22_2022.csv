174,Ontario Research Fund - Research Infrastructure,11658,Advanced Microscopic and Spectroscopic Faclilities to Study Antimicrobial Peptides,"The continuous use of antibiotics over the last 75 years has resulted in the development of strains of bacteria that are now resistant to a wide variety of drugs. At the moment, more than 70 per cent of the bacteria that cause hospital-acquired infections are resistant to at least one of the drugs most commonly used to treat them. Persons infected with drug-resistant organisms are more likely to have longer hospital stays and require treatment with second or third choice drugs that may be less effective, more toxic, and more expensive. As a result, there is now an urgent need to search for alternatives to synthetic antibiotics. Substances called antimicrobial peptides (AMP) are considered to be one of these alternatives. Dr. Anatoli Ianoul of Carleton University will use an Ontario Research Fund infrastructure award to establish new facilities to determine how AMPs act.
