Ontario Research Fund - Research Infrastructure,30720,Examining protein: protein interactions in cellular membranes relevant to the treatment of human diseases,"Dr. Andrews has worked to understand an unusual class of membrane-binding proteins, the Bcl-2 family, that were shown to cause cancer, not by causing cellular growth, but by preventing programmed cellular death. This discovery caused a paradigm shift in cancer biology and interest in regulated apoptosis exploded. It is now apparent that the Bcl-2 protein family regulates the response of tumour cells to chemotherapy by altering their own binding interactions. 

The Bcl-2-mediated interactions depend on where the proteins interact in part because the structural changes resulting from membrane insertion lead to dramatic changes in interacting partners. Thus it is challenging to extrapolate measurements of binding interactions conventionally made in vitro using truncated proteins to what happens in live cells. Furthermore, there are few approaches that can be used to study protein:protein interactions in membranes in vitro and even less for studies in live cells.  Dr. Andrews has developed fluorescence spectroscopy and fluorescence imaging spectroscopy methods to examine them, respectively. These new techniques are now being used by pharmaceutical companies to make new anti-cancer drugs to improve chemotherapy. The infrastructure requested includes core and ancillary equipment required to perform these techniques at an internationally competitive level.
